	// a rhombus board

	// similar coordinates to chess, a3, b4 etc.
	// every square is connected to 6 other squares (if not an edge piece)
	// for example b2 is connected to
	// b1, b3, c1, c2, a2, c4
	// so for a given [x][i] it is connected to
	//	  		[x][i-1]	[x+1][i-1]
	//	[x-1][i]		[x][i]   	[x+1][i]

	// convert board into a a graph paths are only there if same token on squares

	// use some maybe bfs or dfs on it's own
	// is any node on the right in any node on the lefts routing table

	// make routing table

	// first, make graph.
	// how the fuck do you make a graph again?


	// ok so we need a node struct,

	//struct Node
	//{
	//	char id;
	//	int checked;            // for traversing
	//struct Edge* headP;
	//struct Node* leftP;
	//struct Node* rightP;
	//struct Node* q_nextP;
	//	int edge_count;
	//};

	//struct Edge
	//{
	//struct Node* origin;
	//struct Node* destination;
	//struct Edge* nextP;
	//};


		// for our purposes, id will be the coordinates, such as b4 etc.
	// checked will be the same
	// the edge, left and rigth are there to make the linked list of tables.
	// are linked lists possible in go? yes you can
	// edge count is important too

	// first step, given a board, make the nodes

	ok so want to make string board into Tile board.
	spaces are a hassle, have to remove them first.


    next problem is making an id for each tile
    we are given an i,j value for a given tile

    just use that dont need fancy b4 naming fuck that shit yup

    alright so i can make nodes, now time to try make a graph.

    what is the graph? a graph is something like this:

      A| -> B -> D -> E
      B| -> C -> D
      C| -> B -> D
      D| -> F
      E| -> D
      F| -> C

         >C<
        /   \
     >B<     \
    /   \â†“     \
    A---->D----> F
    \    ^
     \ >E|

    first, make a very simple graph.

    graph init function will take in a Board, and add all the edges to it

    first things's first, make an edge making func


    woo ok so the edges are working nicely, wonderful.
    ok so next is to a routing algorithm.
    dfs is probably best.

    ok so how does dfs work? well

    - start at a node. tick it as checked. look at its connected nodes.
    - pick a node that's not connected. tick it checked
    - do the same for new node, check connected, go to one, check it.
    - need a queue



    ok so, we need to implement dfs

    this is a search algorithm for a graph that gets every point.
    I have done an initial queue of nodes that are on the edge and are ready to go.


    i want to go into that queue, go to the first node, and start
    get connected to that node, and put them in a queue
    go into that queue and start again.
    recursive


    works but not for some edge cases, let's explore
